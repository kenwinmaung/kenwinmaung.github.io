I'm an econometrician studying <span style="color:#52adc8">high-dimensional time-series models</span> and <span style="color:#52adc8">structural changes</span> in economics and quantitative finance.

I'd be happy to talk to you about my work on [large time-varying forecasting problems](/research/). I'm also interested in applying econometrics to public health such as in [identifying the impact of political events on Covid-19](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008959).
