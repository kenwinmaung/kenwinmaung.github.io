I'm an Econometrician studying **high-dimensional time-series models** and **structural changes** in economics and quantitative finance. I'd be happy to talk to you about my work on [large time-varying forecasting problems](/research/). 

On the side, I like to apply econometrics to public health such as to [identify the impact of political events on Covid-19](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008959).

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:gmaung@ur.rochester.edu) for R codes used in my projects.
